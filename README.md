CIS 581 Computer Vision
Unviersity Of Pennsylvania

Image mosaicing, focuses on image feature detection, feature matching and image mosaic techniques. The goal of this project is to create an image mosaic or stitching, which is a collection of small images which are aligned properly to create one larger image. We will follow technique outlined in the following papers, which are available on the course website:

“Multi-image Matching using Multi-scale image patches”, Brown, M.; Szeliski, R.; Winder, S. CVPR 2005

“Shape Matching and Object Recognition Using Shape Contexts”, Belongie, S., Malik, J. and Puzicha, J. PAMI 2002: http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/shape/
